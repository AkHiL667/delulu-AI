Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Project Delulu README! This is your go-to guide for understanding this awesome, self-driven project – a real-time chatbot powered by the magic of the Gemini API. Get ready for a delightful and engaging chatting experience! ✨

## What is Project Delulu? 🤔

Project Delulu is a web-based, real-time chatbot designed to bring a little extra fun and personality to your interactions. What makes it special? It's all about customization!

## Built with Love (and Some Cool Tech! 😉)

* **CSS:** Styling that makes Delulu look sleek and appealing. ✨💅
* **JavaScript:** The dynamic engine that powers the real-time interactions and brings Delulu to life. 🚀
* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For smooth and delightful animations that enhance the user interface. Get ready for some eye candy! 🤩
